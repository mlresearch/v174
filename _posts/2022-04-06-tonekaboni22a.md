title: 'How to validate Machine Learning Models Prior to Deployment: Silent trial
  protocol for evaluation of real-time models at ICU'
abstract: Rigorous evaluation of ML models prior to deployment in hospital settings
  is critical to ensure utility, performance, and safety. In addition, a guarantee
  of the usability of such tools requires careful user-centred design and evaluation.
  Such evaluations can be extra challenging for models that measure unquantified and
  complex clinical phenomena like the risk of deterioration. This paper introduces
  a silent trial protocol for evaluating models in real-time in the ICU setting. The
  trial is designed following principles of formative testing with the goal of evaluating
  model performance and gathering information that can be used to refine the model
  to best fit within the intended environment of deployment. We highlight the considerations
  for a systematic evaluation and explain the design and deployment of the components
  that enable this trial. We hope that the principles and considerations introduced
  in this paper can help other researchers validate ML models in their clinical settings.
