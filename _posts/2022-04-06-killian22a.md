title: Counterfactually Guided Policy Transfer in Clinical Settings
abstract: Domain shift, encountered when using a trained model for a new patient population,
  creates significant challenges for sequential decision making in healthcare since
  the target domain may be both data-scarce and confounded. In this paper, we propose
  a method for off-policy transfer by modeling the underlying generative process with
  a causal mechanism. We use informative priors from the source domain to augment
  counterfactual trajectories in the target in a principled manner. We demonstrate
  how this addresses data-scarcity in the presence of unobserved confounding. The
  causal parametrization of our sampling procedure guarantees that counterfactual
  quantities can be estimated from scarce observational target data, maintaining intuitive
  stability properties. Policy learning in the target domain is further regularized
  via the source policy through KL-divergence. Through evaluation on a simulated sepsis
  treatment task, our counterfactual policy transfer procedure significantly improves
  the performance of a learned treatment policy when assumptions of “no-unobserved
  confounding" are relaxed.
